  Number 15, Burger King foot letuce.
  The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger 
  is someone's foot fungus. 
  But as it turns out, that might be what you get.
  A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site 
  showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce.
  With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King."
  Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse.
